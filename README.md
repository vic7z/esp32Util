## Tips & Tricks

1. **Finding Hidden Networks**: Use AP Scanner to detect hidden SSIDs by BSSID
2. **Optimizing Your WiFi**: Use Channel Recommendation to find the best channel
3. **Detecting Interference**: Use Environment Change to establish a baseline, then check later for changes
4. **Walk Tests**: Use AP/BLE Walk Test with graph view to find optimal device placement
5. **Security Monitoring**: Enable Deauth Watch during important activities to detect attacks
6. **Battery Life**: Use Power Mode → Ultra for extended operation
7. **Quick Export**: Use History → Export Data to dump all findings to serial for analysis

## Troubleshooting

### No WiFi APs Detected
- Ensure WiFi is active (Auto Watch, AP Scanner, etc.)
- Check antenna connection
- Try different channels

### No BLE Devices
- BLE takes a few seconds to start scanning
- Ensure BLE devices are advertising nearby
- Try BLE Monitor for dedicated scanning

### Screen Won't Sleep
- Check if you're on a scanning screen (these prevent auto-sleep)
- Verify screen timeout is not set to "Never"
- Use LONG press BACK for manual sleep

### Device Monitor Shows "Scanning..."
- Wait 2-3 seconds for first scan to complete
- Ensure WiFi/BLE devices are nearby
- Check if modems are active (not in sleep mode)
